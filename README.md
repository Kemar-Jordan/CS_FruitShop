Project Idea & Dataflow:
The application being built is a fruit shopping store. The project is called a fruit shop.
The dataflow involves:
1. The user is greeted to the online system.
2. User is given a list of available items.
3. User selects the items they want to buy.
4. Total price is presented to the user.
Project Value Proposition:
The application is supposed to be a quick and easy way for customers to order some of their
favorite fruits and/or produce. The main goal is to encourage people to eat healthier and live
better lives.


Project Technology:
What technology (programming language, libraries, framework etc) will your project use?
If the project involves data, where will you get this data from?
I will utilize predominantly python for the assignment and other key, fundamental programming
concepts.


Project Challenges:
The biggest challenge will come in developing the logic which defines how the user interacts on
the platform.
Project Milestones & Work Division:
Milestones
1) Create startup logic for online stores.
2) Create logic for user interaction.
3) Ensure user information is correctly taken, stored and manipulated
